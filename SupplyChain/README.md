# Dan's Fair Trade Coffee - a Blockchain based Supply Chain Management System

This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a coffee Supply Chain flow. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. 
A Farmer can harvest items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. After harversting, the Farmer will process the item, pack it and put it for sale.
A Distributor can buy the item from the farmer and ship it to a Retailer. Then, a Cosumer can purchase the item from the Retailer.

## Software and packages used:

- Truffle v4.1.15 (core: 4.1.15)
- Ganache CLI v6.4.1 (ganache-core: 2.5.3)
- Solidity v0.4.25 (solc-js)
- Truffle hdwallet provider 1.0.5
- Lite-server 2.4.0

Development done on Windows 10, with Visual Studio Code

## Installing and building:

- Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/grebenisan/blockchain/tree/master/SupplyChain
```
- Change directory to `project-6` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in `package.json`):
```
cd project-6
npm install
```
- Compile the smart contracts:
```
truffle compile --all
```
![truffle compile](images/truffle_compile.png)

- This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

## Running local with Ganache
- Launch Ganache with the same mnemonic sugestd by the skeleton code:
```
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"
```
![ganache-cli](images/ganache_SC_partB.jpg)

- Migrate smart contracts to the locally running (ganache-cli) blockchain:
```
truffle migrate --reset
```
![truffle migrate local](images/truffle_migrate_local.jpg)

- The address of the SupplyChain contract on local is `0x23e2b13b08a22e9eee431f862ec7a17ab1e99b98` 
and the deployment transaction is `0xf4cc98c8f6d94cda0b0a27452d766aa20a6758fcfe007e89f216c9615bf5dc43`

- Test smart contracts:
```
truffle test
```
All 18 tests should pass as in this image:
![truffle test](images/testing_SC_partB.jpg)

- In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:
```
npm run dev
```
The DApp will start in the browser and the Metamask will prompt if you accept the DApp to connect to.

- Make sure the Metamask is set on the first address generated by ganache-cli `0x27d8d15cbc94527cadf5ec14b69519ae23288b95`. 
This address is the owner of the smart contracts.

- Add the Farmer role to the second adress generated by ganache-cli `0x018c2dabef4904ecbd7118350a0c54dbeae3549a`
Put this address in the `Assign Roles to Addresses` top section of the DApp, and click the `add Farmer` button:
![add Farmer](images/add_farmer_local.jpg)

- Add the Distributor role to the third adress generated by ganache-cli `0xce5144391b4ab80668965f2cc4f2cc102380ef0a`
Put this address in the `Assign Roles to Addresses` top section of the DApp, and click the `add Distributor` button:
![add Distributor](images/add_distributor_local.jpg)

- Add the Retailer role to the fourth adress generated by ganache-cli `0x460c31107dd048e34971e57da2f99f659add4f02`
Put this address in the `Assign Roles to Addresses` top section of the DApp, and click the `add Retailer` button:
![add Retailer](images/add_retailer_local.jpg)

- Add the Consumer role to the fifth adress generated by ganache-cli `0xd37b7b8c62be2fdde8daa9816483aebdbd356088`
Put this address in the `Assign Roles to Addresses` top section of the DApp, and click the `add Consumer` button:
![add Farmer](images/add_consumer_local.jpg)

- Switch the current address in Metamask, to the address that was assigned the Farmer role `0x018c2dabef4904ecbd7118350a0c54dbeae3549a`
- In the DApp execute the Farmer steps: Harvest, Process, Pack and ForSale

- Switch the current address in Metamask, to the address that was assigned the Distributor role `0xce5144391b4ab80668965f2cc4f2cc102380ef0a`
- In the DApp execute the Distributor steps: Buy, Ship

- Switch the current address in Metamask, to the address that was assigned the Retailer role `0x460c31107dd048e34971e57da2f99f659add4f02`
- In the DApp execute the Retailer step: Receive

- Switch the current address in Metamask, to the address that was assigned the Cosnumer role `0xd37b7b8c62be2fdde8daa9816483aebdbd356088`
- In the DApp execute the Consumer step: Purchase

- Verfy the events emited by each of these steps:

## Deploying the smart contracts on Rinkeby testnet:

- In the truffle.js file, replace the value of `infuraProjectId` with your Infura key, and the value of `mnemonic` with your Metamask mnemonic.

- Migrate smart contracts to the Rinkeby testnet:
```
truffle.cmd migrate --reset --network rinkeby
```
![truffle migrate Rinkeby](images/truffle_migrate_rinkeby.jpg)

- The address of the SupplyChain contract on Rinkeby is `0x7261fdb838621dd353c807b8a0c6fccbfc5b334f` 
and the deployment transaction is `0x3f63819ffb695fa0c0cc2cdec2bb752204b4a4329928485e2f2552a602cb9ba1`
